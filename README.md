# Snapshop

The inspiration for the project arose from the fact that as young people, we tend to like and forget things pretty fast. We thought that it would be a cool idea to provide the convenience of on-the go shopping to people. We feel that our app can revolutionize the way shopping is done via smartphones.

What it does
Through image recognition the SnapShop app uses the camera of your smartphone to understand and recognize objects around you and gives you the opportunity to explore those items. By doing so, it immediately brings that product to the user with its price and also the ability to order it from Amazon and other vendors.

How I built it
We built the app on the Android platform and used Amazon Web services and Microsoft Visual recognition api to aid us in our pursuit.
